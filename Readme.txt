Test:

Create an MVC Asp.net application in C# backed by Mysql using the base schema structure 
as described by the applicant_test.sql

it should be able to do the following:
 display a list of orders, 
 display an individual order

these views should be clean and have good structure but do not need to be overly styled
 
 
the individual order should calc the total of the order and display it as well as the total quantity of items

foreign keys need to be set up for the order and line item tables. 
you need to also add a table for a user with address 
and link that to the order and display those details on the 
individual order view. 

this should be done with out using the CRUD scaffolding provided in visual studio

include one more feature not listed above that writes to the database,
